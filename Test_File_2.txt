#New File to Test

#Added line to for add/commit Test
#The Item that I originally created will create a text file with the name and then add it.
# The item will have the names and then it will get the names from the note file and add it to the list
# Paths that I want to make for python app:
- Opens a text program that asks you what you want to do, open a note or create a note
- There might be a function for creating a note 
- When a note is open, have the code print text from the note always
